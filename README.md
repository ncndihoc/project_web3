##Update project

Now Goerli testnet will no longer support in future so I'm trying to move to Sepolia testnet but some bugs now. But UI and logic are still work. I will fix it as soon as possible.



## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template vite-javascript-starter
```
